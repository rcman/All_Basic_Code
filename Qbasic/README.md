# Qbasic

Before I started using C I did a lot of testing is Quick Basic. So the draw program which is in another repository started here.

There will be all the Quick Basic code plus graphics and games that will be here. I will upload my files very soon.

I also created a virtual machine in VMware player but I think I'll make the same machine in Virtual box and upload the whole
thing with source, BorlandC and utilities already installed so all you need to do is compile.

BorlandC version is 3.1 so it's DOS based. 

I'll make sure to add any readme notes to the virtual machine if you need to know any steps.
